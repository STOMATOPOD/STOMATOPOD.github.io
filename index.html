                <p>
                    Finding food that is tasty, healthy, and affordable is difficult for college students. 
                    Restaurants with central locations on campus often charge more than ones even a 
                    small distance away. Convenient restaurants also tend to serve food that is unhealthy 
                    to eat regularly, like burgers, bagels, or breakfast biscuits. Our solution should provide 
                    a way for students to find food that is delicious, healthy, and affordable.
